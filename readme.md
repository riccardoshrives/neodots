Now maintained using [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) 😴!

Each plugin is called in its own lua file. Configs live in the same said files so as not to cross contaminate as much as possible.

The idea is that if I no longer need a plugin, I can just delete the respective lua file and be on my way without much fuss.
